# Team_project_FOP

As we know, the goal of this project is to interpret simple algorithms written in Ruby while adhering to a minimal subset of the Ruby language. This subset includes essential
constructs such as variables, loops, conditions and basic arithmetic operations. These algorithms are designed to solve common computational problems and demonstrate the use of these constructs.
Now we can demonstrate the minimal subset and its role. The minimal subset focuses on basic programming elements. For the variables, it used to store values during computation. 
For the arithmetic operations, it includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus to perform mathematical calculations. For the loops, we have a while loop, which iteratively
executes a block of code as long as a condition is true. For the conditions part, there are simple if-else statements to handle decision-making and for the I/O, we have gets for input and puts
for displaying results. By limiting the subset to these components, we ensure simplicity and clarity while interpreting and implementing the algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented using the subset. 
For example, finding the sum of numbers or calculating a factorial shows how loops, arithmetic and conditions work together. Reversing a number or finding the greatest common divisor highlights logical 
steps and iterative calculations. These examples show that even with basic tools, we can solve problems clearly and efficiently, making the concepts easy to understand and apply.

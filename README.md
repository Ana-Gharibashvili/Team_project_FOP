 Here we have defined a ruby subset, which is designed for a java-based interpreter, with a focus on simplicity and essential programming features. The subset 
 supports variable assignment, where values are assigned to variables using the = operator. It includes arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
 multiplication, division, and modulo, enabling basic mathematical computations like adding, multiplying, or calculating remainders. For conditionals, the subset 
 supports if-else statements, which enables decision-making based on boolean conditions. Loops are included to provide iterative control flow. The while loop allows 
 code to repeat under specific conditions. Input/Output (I/O) operations are provided through gets, puts and print. The subset also includes error handling, which 
 detects common issues like invalid syntax, undefined variables, and division by zero. This ensures that the interpreter can handle basic errors gracefully and 
 provide informative error messages.Overall, the syntax of the Ruby subset is designed to support fundamental programming constructs like variable assignment, 
 arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, input/output, and comments. For more details, see the langsubsetdocumentation.md file, where the subset features are 
 described in greater detail.

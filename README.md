   Ruby is a high-level programming language that is known for being simple and easy to use. It was created with the goal of making programming enjoyable and productive,
   so it's easy to read and understand. Ruby supports different ways of writing code, such as object-oriented, procedural and functional programming. It's especially popular in web
   development, largely because of the Ruby on Rails framework which helps developers build web apps quickly. 
   
   
   While Ruby is a powerful and versatile language, its core strengths can be better understood by examining minimal language subsets. A minimal subset focuses on a small but 
   essential portion of the language's features. This approach makes it easier to understand how the language executes basic instructions, manages control flow, and handles 
   variables. By working with a minimal subset, developers can build a solid foundation before diving into Ruby's more complex features.

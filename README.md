 The parser is an important part of our interpreter, responsible for checking and understanding the code written in the ruby subset. It looks at each line of code to 
 make sure it follows the rules of the subset, such as variable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops and I/O.
 If thereâ€™s a mistake in the code, like a syntax error or an incorrect statement, the parser will detect it and show an error message to help fix the issue. Once the 
 code is checked and verified, the parser prepares it so the interpreter can run it properly.
 The main goal of the parser is to keep things simple and accurate, which ensures that the code is easy to understand and errors are handled clearly.
